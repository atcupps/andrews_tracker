This repository contains a simple Python script which scrapes the number of seats in every class at the University of Maryland in roughly 4 to 5 minutes and uploads it to a database. This database is used by my scheduling website [Jupiterp](www.jupiterp.com) to show the number of seats left in a class. Using GitHub actions, this script runs every thirty minutes to keep Jupiterp up to date.
